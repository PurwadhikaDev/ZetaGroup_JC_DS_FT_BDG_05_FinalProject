# Strategic Growth Modernizing Promotion in HR

1. Introduction
This project applies machine learning techniques to assist Human Resources (HR) departments in making data-driven promotion decisions. By analyzing historical employee data and promotion trends, the model predicts which employees are likely to be suitable for promotion, offering an objective supplement to traditional performance evaluation processes.

2. the needs to use our model
Promotion decisions are critical to employee satisfaction, retention, and organizational growth. However, these decisions are often subjective and prone to bias. Key challenges include:

- Inconsistent performance reviews

- Human bias in promotion recommendations

- Lack of standardized promotion criteria

- Implementing a machine learning model can mitigate these challenges by identifying patterns and ensuring fair, consistent decision-making based on objective data.

3. Stakeholders
The primary stakeholders of this project include:

- HR Department: Key users who will utilize the modelâ€™s predictions to assist in promotion decisions

- Management: Decision-makers who approve or review promotions

- Employees: Indirect stakeholders whose careers are impacted by promotion policies

- Data Science Team: Responsible for building, validating, and maintaining the model

4. Goals
Build a machine learning model to predict promotion eligibility by considering:

- Improve fairness and transparency in the promotion process

- Provide actionable insights for HR and management teams

- Reduce the impact of bias and subjective judgment

5. Effects of Model Implementation
The successful deployment of this model can result in:

- Increased transparency in promotion decisions

- Enhanced employee trust in the promotion process

- Reduced bias and improved equity across departments

- Data-backed decision-making leading to better workforce planning

- Identification of high-potential employees early in their careers
